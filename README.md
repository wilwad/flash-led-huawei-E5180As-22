Turn the top LED light on and off.

So I recently signed up for an internet package at the local Telecom here in Namibia (Southern Africa).
They gave me a Huawei 4G LTE cube (Model E5180). It has a nice blue LED on top that can be turned on and off.

From the control web interface (192.168.8.1), you get the option to turn the LED on and off.
I got excited and wanted to use code to toggle the on/off using setInterval.

I used Opera to inspect the traffic between the browser and the server then hacked up some code to turn the LED on/off :)

//Remember to be logged in before pasting the code into the console.
