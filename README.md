Turn the top LED light on and off

So I recently signed up for an contract package at the local Telecom.
They gave me a Huawei 4G LTE cube (Model E5180). 
It has a blue LED on top that can be turned on and off.

From the control web interface (192.168.8.1), you get the option to turn the LED on and off.
I got excited and wanted to use code to toggle the on/off using setInterval.

I used Opera to inspect the traffic between the browser and the server then hacked up some code to turn the LED on/off :)

//Remember to be logged in before pasting the code into the console.

Lots of love, xxx
